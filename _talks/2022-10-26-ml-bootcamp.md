I worked with <a href="https://www.cambridgespark.com/" target="_blank">Cambridge Spark</a>, on their ML-Bootcamp for people working in finance. First, I tutored and helped improve existing modules on various topics including optimization, generative modelling, meta-learning, etc. I then delivered part of the lecture on &quot;Normalizing flows&quot;, where I discussed popular invertible architectures with tractable Jacobians.

Unfortunately, the material used cannot be made public.
