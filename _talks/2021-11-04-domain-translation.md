I introduced a probabilistic framework to learn a bijective mapping between two domains using unpaired data. The framework uses invertible layers with tractable determinant-jacobians to find the mapping using exact likelihood training. You can find some preliminary code at <a href="https://github.com/paramhanji/translation" target="_blank">this Github repo</a>. If you've got an nifty application that stands to benifit from this invertible framework, get in touch.

The talk was part of the *PechaKucha series* conducted by <a href="https://www.girtonmcr.com/" target="_blank">Girton, MCR</a>. Finally, some pictures from the talk, aplogies for the poor quality. In the future, perhaps I will find some time to apply unpaired domain translation to brighten and sharpen images!
