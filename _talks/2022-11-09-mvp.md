This was a one-off lecture for <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/L335/" target="_blank">L335: Machine Visual Perception</a>, an MPhil Course at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge. I discussed popular deep generative architectures, with an emphasis on how they are used in Computer Vision and Graphics.

The course page will be updated with the slides used shortly.
