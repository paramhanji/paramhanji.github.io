Benchmark datasets used for testing computer vision methods often contain little variation in illumination. The methods that perform well on these datasets have been observed to fail under challenging illumination conditions encountered in the real world, in particular when the dynamic range of a scene is high. We present a new dataset for evaluating computer vision methods in challenging illumination conditions such as low-light, high dynamic range, and glare. The main feature of the dataset is that each scene has been captured in all the adversarial illuminations. Moreover, each scene includes an additional reference condition with uniform illumination, which can be used to automatically generate labels for the tested computer vision methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset in a preliminary study, by evaluating the performance of popular face detection, optical flow, and object detection methods under adversarial illumination conditions. We further assess whether the performance of these applications can be improved if a different transfer function is used.
