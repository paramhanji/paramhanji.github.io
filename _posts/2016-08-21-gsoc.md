Back in 2016, I took part in a large open-source program called Google Summer of Code or [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Specifically, I worked with an organization called [BRL-CAD](https://brlcad.org/) which specialised in a computer-aided design (CAD) software. [Here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/4727606599483392) is the official project page from GSoC archives.

Rendering primitives
------
For my GSoC project, I proposed to improve OpenCL support for the BRL-CAD raytracer. I successfully accelerated the rendering of a few primitive shapes such as EPA (elliptical parabolloid), ETO (elliptical torus), PART (lozenge shaped object).

| :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| *Primitive ETO rendered by the OpenCL raytracer* | *Primitive PART rendered by the OpenCL raytracer* |

Subsequently, I reimplemented a boolean weaving algortihm to combine multiple primitives to yield more complex shapes. Boolean operations include Union, Intersection and Difference.
