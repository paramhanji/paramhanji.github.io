Part II dissertations
=====
I am open to discussing <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part-ii/projects" target="_blank">Part II projects</a> in low-level Computer vision and Machine learning (applied to image/video data). Here is list of projects I have supervised in the past:
* (2022) Max McGuinness: *Image rescaling using invertible neural networks by probabilistic disentanglement*
* (2022) Aravind Prabhakaran: *Multi-monitor Gaze-tracking Assisted Mouse Control*
* (2020) Wilson Suen: *Image segmentation by depth and color*
