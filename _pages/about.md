Welcome to my home on the web! I am final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/" target="_blank">Rafa≈Ç Mantiuk</a>. My current research is on inverse problems in computational photography and computer vision. In recent and ongoing projects, I apply noise-optimal statistical estimators to imaging problems. My other research interests include probablistic generative modeling and deep invertible networks.

When I'm not working, I'm probably at <a href="https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Girton</a> playing tennis or squash. Get in touch if you'd like to play a game or simply converse over a mug of hot chocolate.
