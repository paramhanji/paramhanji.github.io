Welcome to my home on the web! I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aco41/" target="_blank">Cengiz Öztireli</a> at Cambridge. My current research focuses on probabilistic generative models applied to images as well as 3D data. Prior to October 2022, I did my PhD on inverse problems in high dynamic range imaging under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/" target="_blank">Rafał Mantiuk</a>. Many years before this, I completed my undergrad in *Information Technology* from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), India.
