Welcome to my home on the web! I am final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, currently supervised by [Rafa≈Ç Mantiuk](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/). My current research is on inverse problems in computational photography and computer vision. In recent and ongoing projects, I apply noise-optimal statistical estimators to imaging problems. My other research interests include probablistic generative modeling and deep invertible networks.
